As part of my Masterâ€™s in Big Data Analytics for Business, I collaborated with Arajem Aboudi and  Benjamin Ro KjÃ¦rulf Jacobsen on a financial data science project.
Our goal? Engineer a structured basetable from complex financial data to analyze loan approvals and credit card issuance patterns.
This project was a great opportunity to work on a full data science pipeline, focusing on data extraction, feature engineering, and business-driven analysis, reinforcing abilities to structure and document data science projects efficiently.

Full Data Pipeline: From Raw Data to Structured Intelligence :
- âœ… Multi-Source Data Integration: Merging relational banking datasets (clients, accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards) into a cohesive, analytics-ready basetable.
- âœ…Feature Engineering: 
Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis for financial behavior profiling.
Account Tenure (LOR) Calculation to quantify banking relationship stability.
Aggregated Financial Metrics (total credit, withdrawals) to detect spending patterns.
Demographic Segmentation to analyze client behavior by age group.
- âœ… Target Variable Creation:
Loan Granted in 1997 ðŸ“Š
Credit Card Issued in 1997 ðŸ’³
- âœ… Robust Data Cleaning & Optimization: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and statistical refinements to ensure data integrity and predictive reliability.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights Uncovered :
- ðŸ”¹ High-frequency transactions & strong RFM scores signal greater financial engagement.
- ðŸ”¹ Recent withdrawals & transaction volumes correlate with higher lending activity.
- ðŸ”¹ Longer account tenure aligns with stronger trust and higher credit allocation.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways & Skills Strengthened :
- âœ… End-to-End Data Processing: Mastering data wrangling, feature extraction & transformation at scale.
- âœ… Data-Driven Financial Analytics: Decoding banking behaviors through structured analytics and advanced data engineering.
- âœ… Project Structuring & Documentation: Delivering a well-organized data science pipeline in a team setting.
- âœ… Business-Centric Data Science: Translating raw data into actionable insights for financial decision-making.

This project reinforced the critical role of clean, structured, and engineered data in driving meaningful financial insights.
